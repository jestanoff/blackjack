# Blackjack React Game

## Get going

1. Install with `yarn install` or `npm i`
2. Start the dev server with `yarn start` or `npm run start`
3. Tests `yarn test` or `npm run test`
4. Build the game in /build folder `yarn build` or `npm run build`

#### Notes

* I used React 1.6
* Enzyme needs an adapter to run with React 1.6, but this adapter cannot be configured as React Create app is not allowing certain package.json configurations
* I initially wanted to use Flow for type checking but it is not easy to configure it with React Create app
* Some of the components filenames/folder are lower case as I got issues with git mv not picking up the capitalisation as a change. My intension was to make all components name as Capital case.
